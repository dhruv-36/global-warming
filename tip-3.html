        <h1>Eat a Plant-Based Diet</h1>
        <p>Eating a plant-based diet can have a positive impact on the environment and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Here are some tips to get started:</p>
        <div class="tip">
          <h2>Start Slowly</h2>
          <p>If you are new to plant-based eating, start slowly by incorporating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes into your diet. Gradually reduce your intake of meat and dairy products over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <h2>Explore New Recipes</h2>
          <p>Explore new recipes and try different types of plant-based foods. Experiment with tofu, tempeh, seitan, and other vegetarian protein sources. There are plenty of delicious plant-based options available!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <h2>Shop Local and Seasonal</h2>
          <p>Shop for local and seasonal fruits and vegetables. This can help reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting food long distances. Plus, local produce is often fresher and tastier!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <h2>Reduce Food Waste</h2>
          <p>Reduce food waste by planning your meals ahead of time and only buying what you need. Use leftover vegetables and grains to create new meals. Compost food scraps to create nutrient-rich soil for your garden!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
          <h2>Spread the Word</h2>
          <p>Tell your friends and family about the benefits of a plant-based diet. Encourage them to try new plant-based recipes and join you in reducing their carbon footprint!</p>
