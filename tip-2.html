      <h1>Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle</h1>
      <p>Reducing, reusing, and recycling are important practices that can help reduce our carbon footprint and combat global warming. These practices can help conserve resources, reduce waste, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <h2>How reducing can help</h2>
      <p>Reducing involves using fewer resources and consuming less in order to minimize waste and conserve resources. Here are some ways to reduce:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups instead of single-use items.</li>
        <li>Buy products with minimal packaging, or packaging that can be recycled.</li>
        <li>Conserve energy by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using energy-efficient appliances.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How reusing can help</h2>
      <p>Reusing involves finding new uses for items in order to extend their lifespan and reduce waste. Here are some ways to reuse:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use cloth napkins and towels instead of paper ones.</li>
        <li>Donate or sell old clothing, furniture, and electronics instead of throwing them away.</li>
        <li>Reuse containers and jars for storage instead of buying new ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How recycling can help</h2>
      <p>Recycling involves turning waste materials into new products instead of throwing them away. Here are some ways to recycle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recycle paper, plastic, glass, and metal products.</li>
        <li>Compost food waste and yard waste to create nutrient-rich soil.</li>
        <li>Buy products made from recycled materials.</li>
      </ul>
